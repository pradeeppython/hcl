'''
Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions:
Because functions are objects we can pass them as arguments to other functions. 
Functions that can accept other functions as arguments are also called higher-order functions. 
In the example below, we have created a function greet which takes a function as an argument.

# Python program to illustrate functions 
# can be passed as arguments to other functions
def shout(text): 
    return text.upper() 
  
def whisper(text): 
    return text.lower() 
  
def greet(func): 
    # storing the function in a variable 
    greeting = func("Hi, I am created by a function passed as an argument.") 
    print greeting  
  
greet(shout) 
greet(whisper)
